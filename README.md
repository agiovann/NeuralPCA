## Installation

Clone the repository or unzip the source and add recursively folders from the src folder to the MATLAB path

## EXAMPLES 

### Basic Example

``` Matlab
k -> subspace dimension
d -> number of features
% we suggest to standardize data using the standardize_data function
[X,~,~] = standardize_data(X,0,0);

fsm = FSM(k, d, [], [], [], []);
for i = 1:n    
    fsm.fit_next(x(:,i)');
end

components = fsm.get_components([]);
```
